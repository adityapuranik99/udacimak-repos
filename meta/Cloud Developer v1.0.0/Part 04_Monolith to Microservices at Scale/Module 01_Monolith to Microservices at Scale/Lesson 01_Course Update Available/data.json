It takes a strategic approach for refactoring a monolith to microservice.\n <br><br>\n- **Container** is now **Containers Using Docker**.   <br>\nThe updates provide more context on why we use containers and includes a  hands-on demonstration on how we can run the same application locally vs. in a container. Strategies to improve Docker performance are also discussed.\n <br> <br>\n- **Independent releases and deployments** now appears earlier in the course in the **Automating the Application Development Lifecycle**  lesson.   <br>\nThe updated lesson includes a new focus on hands-on for building out Continuous Integration (CI) and context on how, what, and why continuous integration is used.  It also ties in Docker as a building block for continuous integration.\n <br> <br>\n- **Kubernetes** is now **Orchestration with Kubernetes**.  <br>\nThe lesson now includes context on why we use Kubernetes and how it fits in the big picture with Docker and CI. It also discusses how you can streamline the setup of Kubernetes natively on AWS with EKS.\n <br><br>\n- **Service Registration, Discoveryâ€Š & Scaling**  is now **Best Practices/Design Patterns for Kubernetes in Production**.  <br>\nThe updated lesson introduces best practices for scaling and durability using Kubernetes in production as well as best practices for security and forensics for microservices in production.\n\n##  Which Course Should I Use?\n\nIt's up to you. Either course will prepare you for the **Refactor Udagram app to Microservices Project**.\n",
