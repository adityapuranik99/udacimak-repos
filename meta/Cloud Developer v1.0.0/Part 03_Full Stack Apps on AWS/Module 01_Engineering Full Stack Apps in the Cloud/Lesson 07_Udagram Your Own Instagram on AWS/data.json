The project submission should include a Git repository and a link to the endpoint URL for a running elastic beanstalk deployment (provided through the student notes).\n\n## Starter Code\nThe project starter code can be found here:  \n[Image Filter Starter Code](https://github.com/udacity/cloud-developer/tree/master/course-02/project/image-filter-starter-code)\n\n\n## Tasks\n\n### Setup Node Environment\n\nYou'll need to create a new node server. Open a new terminal within the project directory and run:\n\n1. Initialize a new project: `npm i`\n2. run the development server with `npm run dev`\n\n### Create a new endpoint in the server.ts file\n\nThe starter code has a task for you to complete an endpoint in `./src/server.ts` which uses query parameter to download an image from a public URL, filter the image, and return the result.\n\nWe've included a few helper functions to handle some of these concepts and we're importing it for you at the top of the `./src/server.ts`  file.\n\n```typescript\nimport {filterImageFromURL, deleteLocalFiles} from './util/util';\n```\n\n### Deploying your system\n\nFollow the process described in the course to `eb init` a new application and `eb create` a new environment to deploy your image-filter service! Don't forget you can use `eb deploy` to push changes.\n\n## Stand Out (Optional)\n\n### Refactor the course RESTapi\n\nIf you're feeling up to it, refactor the course RESTapi to make a request to your newly provisioned image server.\n\n### Authentication\n\nPrevent requests without valid authentication headers.\n> !!NOTE if you choose to submit this, make sure to add the token to the postman collection and export the postman collection file to your submission so we can review!\n\n### Custom Domain Name\n\nAdd your own domain name and have it point to the running services (try adding a subdomain name to point to the processing server)\n> !NOTE: Domain names are not included in AWSâ€™ free tier and will incur a cost.\n\n## Project Submission Checklist\n\n**Before submitting your project, please review and confirm the following items.** \n<input type=\"checkbox\"> I am confident all rubric items have been met and my project will pass as submitted.\n<input type=\"checkbox\"> Project builds correctly without errors and runs.\n<input type=\"checkbox\"> All required functionality exists and my project behaves as expected per the project's specifications.\n\n**Once you have checked all these items, you are ready to submit!**\n",
