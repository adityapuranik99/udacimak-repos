This project will be an important part of your portfolio that will help you achieve your Cloud-related career goals.\n\nIn this project, you will build a cloud-based application, and follow the principles of either the Microservices course (course 3) or the Serverless course (course 4).  This will help you demonstrate to potential employers and colleagues that you can independently create and deploy applications using these principles.\n",

Review the rubric for each option, to ensure that the application you build **satisfies at least 3 of the rubric requirements**.  **Not all rubric items need to be satisfied in order to pass the project**.  We hope that you’ll feel that you have enough flexibility to focus on the aspects of your application that you are most interested in.\n\n#### Step 3: Build your application\nBuild either a containerized microservices app, or a serverless app.\n\n#### Step 4: Test your application\nWrite unit tests and perform integration tests or user based testing.  \n",
