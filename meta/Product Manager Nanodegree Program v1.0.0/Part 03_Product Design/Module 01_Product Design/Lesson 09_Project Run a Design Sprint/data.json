Create a Research Plan\n - Create a research plan\n   - Identify your target user\n   - Map out the flow of the interview \n    - Intro\n    - Background information\n    - Tasks\n    - Wrap Up\n\n\n2. Run User Studies - Inviting users in to participate in studies is a great way to get feedback if you are on the right track. Additionally, it’s also easier to course correct at this point before any code has been written. We’re going to invite 2 users to try out the prototype that you built. You’ll use the research plan you created to guide the study and will record the audio from the session. You should also plan to take notes during the session.\n\n - Schedule two meetings with people you can interview about your prototype\n    - Note: It might not be possible to find someone who meets your target user criteria-- and that’s ok for the sake of this exercise\n  - Run through your interview script in the research plan.\n    - You will ask some background questions to the participant and then ask them to complete several tasks\n - Make sure to take notes during the interview (you can use the research plan as a template for notes)\n - You should record the audio of the interview\n - You should plan to spend about 30 minutes per interview\n\n  \n\n3. Prepare for a feasibility conversation - Now that you’ve created an interactive prototype of your concept, it’s important to make sure that it can actually be built. Engage with engineering early on, to make sure you understand the tradeoffs of how design decisions can impact timelines. Prepare to have a feasibility conversation with your engineering team or lead.\n\n - Map out dynamic elements that are displayed in your UI\n    - Identify where you assume the underlying data is coming from\n    - List questions you have around these assumptions\n - Map out what data you collect from your users (ie: text input field) and how it will be used\n    - Identify where you assume this data is being stored\n    - List questions you have around these assumptions\n - Map out your expectations around latency\n     - Identify things that you think might increase latency\n     - List questions you have around these assumptions\n\n\n",
