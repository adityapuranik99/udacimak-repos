You’ll learn more about how you can use Design Thinking to diverge in order to explore ideas and then ultimately focus in and converge on a single idea. Equally important is mapping out the full concept and creating a prototype that can be used to validate that you’re solving a problem for real users.\n\n\n\nAt the end of this course and after completing your project, you will be able to:\n- Organize and run a Design Sprint to create a product that solves a user need\n- Create sketches, storyboards, and build interactive prototypes\n- Design a  research plan to validate product concept and identify usability issues along critical user journeys\n- Recruit participants and conduct usability tests following a research plan\n- Translate user insights into product improvements",

By setting goals you can work backwards to understand what needs to happen in order to get there.\n\n## 3. Sketch\nIdeate. Start diverging and exploring lots of different solutions.\n\n## 4. Decide\nBring it all back together and decide on one idea to take through prototyping and validation\n\n## 5. Prototype\nMap out and build a prototype of your idea\n\n## 6. Validate\nCheck to make sure that your idea is solving a real user need… and that it can be built!\n\nEach phase has a set of tools that can be used to facilitate reaching the goal of each phase. Remember, it’s not necessary to use every tool for a given phase. Instead you should focus on picking the best tool for the problem you are trying to tackle and the composition of your sprint team.

It really depends… But here are a few possibilities\n- More testing and iteration\n- The concept will go to Design to be more fully fleshed out\n- The concept will go to Engineering to build\n- Make a case with leadership to invest more resources in bringing concept to market\n- The concept is abandoned because it doesn’t address a user need\n- and lots more\n\nBefore the sprint starts, it’s a good practice to plan what the next steps afterward will be. But it’s also important to acknowledge and respond appropriately based on the outcome of the sprint. \n",

Two quick icebreakers you can use are:\n* Two truths and a lie - each team member introduces themselves and includes three facts about themselves. Two of them are true and one is false.

Acknowledge that designers have expertise when talking about UI and flows\r\n* When critiquing a design it’s often more effective to ask about the ***intention*** of a choice \n\nDesign is a critical partner for Product Managers. It’s important to cultivate strong relationships and understand and acknowledge the perspective of your Designer(s). Your style of communication goes a long way. When critiquing a design, keep in mind that it’s often more effective to ask about the intention of a choice rather than saying you don’t like something. \r\rFor example, asking *\"What was the reasoning behind placing the button in the right corner?\"* can then develop into further conversation where you can share that you are worried that users might be confused and not able to find the button due to its placement. This is a much more effective way to work with Designers than saying *\"I don’t like where the button is placed.\"* or *\"The button is placed in a confusing location.\"*\n ",
