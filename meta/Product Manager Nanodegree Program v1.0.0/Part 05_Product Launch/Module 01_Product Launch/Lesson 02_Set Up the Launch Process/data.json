Communicating a clear plan gives you a vote of confidence.   \n<br>\n- **Time is important**:     \rYou will have a lot of stressful launches, where time is extremely short. When you can and have enough time, don’t wait till the last minute to loop in your partners because they might have other priorities.   \n<br>\n- **Think outside of the box**:     \rWhether it is a launch, thinking through risks or thinking about how to scale your product, find creative ways to do things faster or better. When thinking about risks, think beyond the obvious ones.    \n<br>\n- **Learn, research and ask for help**:    \rWhen the time comes and you need to scale your product, learn and research what you can and ask others for help. Great planning goes a long way when you need to scale your product. Think about how you can get quick wins, what can be done fast and what needs more work. Consider your markets, which one has the higher potential.   \n<br>\n- **Be the glue**:    \rYou are the glue of the team, you are the motivator, you are the one who is going to push the team in the hard moments.
