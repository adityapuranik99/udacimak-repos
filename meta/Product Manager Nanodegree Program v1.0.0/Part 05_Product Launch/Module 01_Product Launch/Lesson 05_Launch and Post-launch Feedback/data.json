              "text": "\n### Launch Patterns \n\n- A gradual rollout is the safest choice for a software product:\n - Allows you to closely monitor performance metrics to identify issues  and make any necessary fixes before launching to everyone. Oftentimes you might run into bugs at scale that you could not catch or predict before rolling out   \n - Gives you an early read if the product is on track to achieve goals\n<br>\n\n - Easy to rollback the launch if any major issues arise\n\n- A full launch makes more sense for a:\n  - Hardware product.  Once a product is on the shelf it has to work for any user who purchases it. You can still do beta testing, but it will be more challenging to get a physical product to your target users.  Additionally, you can't just \"push\" a new feature to an existing physical product like you can with software since you are limited by the capabilities of the hardware. <br>\n\n  -  \"No-brainer\" product.  It is a low-risk launch if your team is confident that the product will be well-received in the market and will work as expected. \n \n- It also may make sense to do a full launch to meet a product goal or a legal requirement. There may be times when leadership decides that the need for immediate revenue is worth the risk of launching an imperfect product. Or changes in law, that require product updates for compliance, like GDPR privacy regulations in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n####   How to Manage a Gradual Rollout  \n\n- For a new product, a gradual rollout involves launching the product to a small or geographically contained group of users   \r<br>  \n- For a new feature on an existing product, you'll want to make the feature available to a select group of  users of the existing product.  \n<br>  \n- You'll want to be strategic about the number of users you start with.  You need enough users to get a good read on the users' reception of the project and to make sure any issues are uncovered. You will almost always want to start with 1% on the first day  \n<br>\n- After launch, monitor KPIs and user feedback  \n  -  No issues -> release the product to more users.   \n<br>  \n  - If KPIs look problematic or issues appear in user feedback, halt the rollout or roll the feature back.  Fix it and try again.\n",

People need to know about the great work you did.   \n<br>  \n- Your team deserves recognition as well. It is a part of your job to make sure they get it. \n\n\n#### Internal Launch Email Tips\n\n- Start your launch email with a story to capture people’s attention.  \n- It is a good idea to add some graphics on top of it. Ask your UX design team to help out.\n- Briefly describe next steps for your product: new features, scaling and improvements -- but don't go into too much detail.  This is not a road map\n- Thank all the people who worked on the launch by name. It is always important to recognize the people who did the work!  \n- Launches are a cause for celebration so the tone of the email should be upbeat and exciting! \n\n",

The main complaint was that when the user has a lot of followers, they can’t find their most important ones and it makes the interaction with these followers less meaningful.\n\nAfter a lot of internal discussions, we conducted User Research and decided to redesign our Followers tab! Now users can see the followers they interacted with the most.\n\nOur numbers from the launch are… <here the PM for the product would add real numbers>. \n\nWe are very excited to continue iterating on this feature as we see interactions between users as most essential for Instagram’s growth. Next are testing more <what they will do next>. We are also exploring different options to show user’s new ways to interact with followers. \n\nThank you to the most amazing team ever!”\n\n",

There is a different type of email that is written to send to people outside your company to increase the buzz for your product.  \n\n- **When to Use**: External launch emails can definitely be helpful for bigger product feature launches. they don't always make sense for smaller features or behind the hood launches/improvements that aren’t visible to users.\n<br>\n- **Purpose**:  While an internal launch email is more focused on congratulating the team, an external is more focused on driving adoption of  the new feature.\n<br>  \n- **Target**: External emails are sent to anyone who might be interested in your product. In many cases, this can be your existing user base or users who have joined a waitlist to hear more about your product.\n\n\n\n#### What Should be in an External Launch Email?  \n\nExternal emails should include much more marketing messaging about the product or feature and its value. \n\n- What the product or feature is\n- Why users should care/be excited about it\n\n- How users can use it\n- When users can expect it (if it's not available immediately)\n- Where to go for more info/help\n\n### External Launch Email Examples  ",

He tried to understand what he needed for the party so he created a great spreadsheet, then he used multiple tools: one to invite people and manage RSVPs, then another one to order food and a venue, then answer multiple questions from a friend: what can they get for Karen. “ \n\nThen we will describe what we launched and share the results: \n\n>We launched our Party Master in the US. Our results are 100K downloads. We have 30K parties organized through our platform. \n\nWe will add some customer’s testimonials: \n\n\n>“Where was this app until now?? It made my party organizing so much easier!” \n\nWe will explain what is next for the product:\n\n>We are going to add more features based on our customer feedback and we are looking to launch internationally! \n\nWe will add “thank yous” to all the people involved in the development of our app.\n\n>This launch would not be possible without the hard work of all the members of our team. \n\n\n\n**Launch Emails are important for promoting your team and your work, and are a great tool for reaching a wider audience.**\n\n\n",

Dashboards also help you to communicate with your leadership.  \n<br>\n- **Metrics might not be enough.** \rYou need to listen to your users and customers by reading reviews for your app, asking customer support to pull statistics for your app reviews, looking for articles about your product, sending surveys. For big customers, ask the support team to do outreach and pass you the feedback.  <br>\n<br>  \n- **Document the feedback in a central location.**   \rInvite others to contribute. Look for patterns and themes in the data.  Identify the underlying problems and start developing possible solutions\n<br>  <br>\n- **Add problems and solutions  to the PRD.**  \rStart planning how you will test your solutions. \n\n\n\n",
