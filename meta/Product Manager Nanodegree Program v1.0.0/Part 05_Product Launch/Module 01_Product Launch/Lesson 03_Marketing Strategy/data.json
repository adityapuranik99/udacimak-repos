This includes:\n- Pricing strategy- how you capture value\n- Channel strategy- how you distribute your product\n- Marketing campaigns- how you explain your product\n- Customer journey map- how customers learn about and interact with your product\n- Training for sales and support teams- how internal teams sell and help user with the product\n\n\n       \n\n**Value Proposition**:  Benefits that your product delivers to address your target user’s needs. Another way to think about it: your product’s value proposition answers the question why your target user would buy/use your product.\n\n**Product Positioning**: Where your product fits in the market for your target audience(s) given the product's value proposition. This can also highlight how your product is different compared to other products. You can have multiple product positioning statements\n\n**Marketing Message**:  A concise statement of the value your product delivers to users based on your product positioning. The marketing message should be easy for users to understand and convey what our product does.   \n\n\n\n### Things to Remember About Working with PMMs on a Go-to-Market Strategy  \n- **Joint effort**:  A solid go-to-market strategy requires the PM and PMM to closely work together. The PM is more of the product expert and the PMM is the market expert and both types of expertise is needed.  \n<br>\n- **Document the details**:  It is critical to create a shared document with details about the product.  Documenting the details  ensures that everyone is working with the same information and prevents misunderstandings.   \n<br>\n- **Frequent meetings**:  Communicate!  Communicate!  Communicate! You need to follow up as the launch approaches to ensure that there are no last minute delays.\n",

You’ll want to start with your product’s value proposition to help you create the  product positioning statements.  Once you have the product positioning you can create the messaging.\n\n### Value Proposition   \r\rAs a reminder the value proposition for the product is created well before launch because it drives how the product that is designed and built.\n\n\n### Product Positioning\n\nProduct positioning should be:\n\n1. More specific than your product’s value prop\n2. Focused on a specific target user, audience, or segment\n3. Include differentiation that is meaningful for this specific audience\n\nCombine these three parts into one sentence:    \n\nFor ***{Target Audience}***,   ***{Product Name}*** delivers  ***{Product Benefit} *** better than other products because ***{Evidence of Superiority} ***   \n\n\n#### Example\n\n*“For World Wide Web users who enjoy books, Amazon.com is a retail bookseller that provides instant access to over 1.1 million books. Unlike traditional book retailers, Amazon.com provides a combination of extraordinary convenience, low prices, and comprehensive selection.”*\n\nThis example is from a time when Amazon was just focused on selling books.  As the company has grown,  Amazon's value proposition and product positioning has evolved. \n\n\n### Marketing Message   \n\n\n\nOnce you have determined your product positioning you can write your marketing message.  The marketing message should communicate your product positioning in a concise statement that is easy for users to remember. Some tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. Be clear and concise\n2. Make it memorable\n3. Consider including a call to action\n\n#### Examples\n\n*“AirPods deliver effortless, all-day audio on the go. And AirPods Pro bring Active Noise Cancellation to an in-ear headphone — with a customizable fit. Find the right AirPods for you.”* - [Apple AirPods](https://www.apple.com/airpods/)\n\n*“Venmo is a digital wallet that lets you make and share payments with friends. You can easily split the bill, cab fare, or much more. Download the iOS or Android app or sign up on Venmo.com today.”* - [Venmo](http://www.venmo.com)\n\n*“Make Your Day. Real People. Real Videos.

Here is one simple method:    \n\n1. **Understand who your competitor sees as their target customers**.    For public companies, you may be able to identify the target customers from the company's published mission statement.  Private companies will be trickier.  Look for published research and articles online.  \n<br>\n2. **Search for market statistics** .  Look for both general data about the market space and specific data about the market leaders. That should give you a good view of the size of the market and the relative shares of your competitors.  \n<br>\n3.  **Focus on the share smaller competitors are getting**.  That should give you a good sense of how much of the market share can be gained by targeting the smaller players.  Taking on the biggest competitor from the get-go might be tricker. ",

For example, you usually will start will everyone in the world and narrow down that audience to people who are interested in your product.\n- Bottoms Up\n - This involves using known data points that you have (data from early customers and sales) that you could extrapolate to represent a larger market opportunity. For example, if you are already selling a product in one region and were considering selling it globally.\n- Value Theory\n - Generally used for new product categories where you don’t have much information to base estimates on. This involves conducting market research to understand how much people would pay for your product and how many potential customers you have.\n\n## Additional Reading\n\nRead more about TAM here:  \n\n* [How to calculate your total addressable market and make a great TAM slide for investors](https://www.forentrepreneurs.com/calculating-tam/)\n\n",

It is especially important if you are entering a new market.  \n<br>\n- **Estimate your competitor's market share**: Start by researching the target audience for the competitor. Research as much as you can and read multiple articles. You will probably need to extrapolate the available data to calculate the competitor's market share.   \n<br>\n- **Don't be discouraged by strong competitors**  Just because there are strong competitors, it doesn’t mean that there is no room for one more, especially if you have better product.  \n<br>\n- **Do your research and move on**: Do not go down the rabbit hole and spend too much time doing research. You have a product to launch! \n\n\n### Sources used in our TAM calculation:\n*It is always important to cite any data you use!*\n\n\n- [Quartz: The US is now buying more stretchy pants than blue jeans](https://qz.com/1218844/the-us-bought-more-yoga-pants-leggings-and-other-elastic-fabrics-than-blue-jeans-in-2017/)\n\n- [A Growth Strategy for Lululemon 2018](https://medium.com/@michaelangelo_q/a-growth-strategy-for-lululemon-68819680e511)\n\n- [US Population by Gender](\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/737923/us-population-by-gender)\n\n- [CSI Market: LULU's Competition by Segment and its Market Share](\nhttps://csimarket.com/stocks/competitionSEG2.php?code=LULU)\n\n- [90 degrees by Reflex]( \nhttps://www.90degreebyreflex.com/pages/about-us)\n\nIf you search a bit more about Lululemon, you can run into this very interesting data:  \n\n- [Lululemon’s website stats]( \nhttps://www.similarweb.com/website/lululemon.com#search)\n\n",
