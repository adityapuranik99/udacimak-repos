Apple App Store for example, requires Releases notes which contain all the new features coming to your latest release.   \n**Sales**: The Sales team is responsible for selling your product.   \n**Customer Support**: Customer support team is the team that takes care of all customer complaints.   \n**Technical Writers** Technical writers are responsible for writing all  of the documentation in the company. In some cases, they help with UI copy as well.  \n**Product Specialists**: The Product Specialist role varies based on the company and product. In some cases they work closely with sales and customers with large accounts. In other cases they act as a bridge between Product and support teams.  \n\n\n\n  \n### Things to Remember About the Additional Teams We Need to Work With\n\nAs we get closer to launch we need to work with the teams that are closer to the users  \n- Sales\n- Customer support\n- Technicals Writers\n- Product Specialists\n\n#### How is it different for different types of products?\n\n\nThere will be different workflows if you work on different types of products:\n- Consumer: you will probably work closely with Customer Support, maybe with Technical Writers if there is a help center for your product. \n\n- Enterprise Product : you might work with all different teams, including Sales, Technical Writers, Customer Support.  It all depends on your product and the structure of your company \n\n\n#### How to work with different teams? \n- Create collaterals and documentation\n-  You must work closely with them because they own the communication channels with your users\n- Your role is to empower these teams to be successful by providing them information about the product\n\n\n#### What if there are none of these functions in your startup?\n \nThen it is probably ***your*** responsibility as the Product Manager to handle these items.
