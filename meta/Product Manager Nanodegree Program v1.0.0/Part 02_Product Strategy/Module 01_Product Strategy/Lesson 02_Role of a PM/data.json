This can be accomplished through a variety of different mediums like presentations and conversations. \r\rAll PMs write PRDs to frame the problem and document requirements for the solution.\r\rYou can test the effectiveness of your communication by asking people on the team \"What are we building and why?\" If you ask 5 people that question and get the same answer back from everyone the PM is doing a good job. If you ask 5 people and get 6 different answers back, the PM has more work to do\n\n\n- **Coordinating development and launch**  \nPMs are also responsible for coordinating the development and launch of their product across all the various cross functional partners involved (design, engineering, marketing, legal, support, etc). This doesn’t mean PMs do all the work; they facilitate conversations and help to remove blockers or things that might be slowing the team down. They also make sure that everything that needs to happen does actually happen. \n\n\n- **Responding to new information**  \nThings change all the time. PMs need to stay up to date with the latest information. Whether that’s from new insights from user research, results from an experiment, feedback from the support team, new product launch from a competitor.\n\n\n- **Responding to fires**  \nPMs need to be able to juggle multiple tasks and quickly switch focus when priorities change, (i.e. there is an outage).\n\n\n",

Keep in mind that identifying requirements is a much more active and involved process than just “gathering.” It’s important that PMs understand the problem and why a specific requirement exists. \nIdentifying Requirements can happen through a variety of channels:\n- Research\n- Prototyping\n- Input from users / customers\n- Input from cross functional partners\n\nAnd two common challenges that come up when identifying requirements are:\n1. Never be sure that all requirements have been identified\n2. Users might not be able to tell you what the product should do (ie: the requirement). Instead it’s better to focus on understanding the problem the user is facing and their needs. Ask why. Then ask why again. And keep asking why until you get to a deeper understanding.\n",

This section also helps to explain WHY the problem should be solved.\n - Describe the requirements and answers WHAT does the product do? Remember, as a PM you are answering WHAT the product does. Design and engineering have to figure out HOW.\n\nBoth Roadmaps and PRDs should evolve over time as the team is iterating through problems and gets new information.",
