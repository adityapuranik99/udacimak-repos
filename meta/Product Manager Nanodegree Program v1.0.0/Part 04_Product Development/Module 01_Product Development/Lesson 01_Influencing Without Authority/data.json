If you look at their company, they are trying to cater to individuals who are comfortable with technology and confident to exercise individually within the confines of their home without the need to be in a fitness gym space. This distinguishes their target customer very clearly from those individuals who do not like working out of a home but would rather go to a gym and have a place that is dedicated to exercise.\n- **Demographics Segmentations** is used to categorize people based on race, gender, and other demographic traits.\n\nDemographic segmentation is an outcome of the psychographic segmentation since we now know an individual's sexual orientations. Others can be categorized based on age group, income bracket, and geographical locations\n\n- **Behavioral Segmentation** is another key attribute that will help you understand user behavior. What action do your customers take, why do they take it and when i.e how frequently. In our Sworkit example, the exercisers prefer to work out on a regular basis (could be twice a week, five a week) depending upon a combination of factors such as their fitness level, time available to workout.\n\n- **Needs-based Segmentation** The key to success will be understanding their unmet needs that will help you pick the right problem to solve. \n",

A workout routine could include a specific number of workouts to be completed within a week. This workout routine could be pre-defined or customized but also what goes into each workout matters. If the workout needs of the target customers are: As an individual exerciser that likes working out of home, I would like to join other exercisers virtually at the same time to follow the same set of exercises (e.g Zumba ) vs. As an individual exerciser that likes working out of home, I would like to start a workout and follow the exercise instructions on my TV screen. These are very different needs and there are going to different ways to solve them.\n\n- **Market Size**.  We can better understand the market size based on the target customer that has been defined using segmentation techniques above.\n\nWe can narrow down the market size to individual adults who are willing to use digital fitness products like mobile apps to progress in their fitness journey towards an active and healthy lifestyle in the U.S.\n\n- **Market Trends**\nNext, we want to consider what are the different market trends that affect the company? it could be a combination of different factors such as your customer needs and preferences are changing, technology and advancements in the Fitness is changing. you need to be aware of this. It's important to understand if your identified market is growing or shrinking.\n\n\n- **Expand Your Target Segment **\nHow you expand is very crucial because as a company you're going to have limited resources and time. Define potential adjacent where the company’s capabilities and strengths can be easily extended to create a new product to satisfy a new segment, which will help the company generate additional value in terms of revenue. \n",

All this quantitative data will become more powerful when you actually combine it with qualitative data because this is going to help you understand your customers better and make your storytelling more powerful.\n\n### Talk to Your Customers\nOne of the most often undervalued but powerful tactic is talking to your customers. Interview your customers to gather information about what they do, why do they do what they do? Is their a current alternative product used, what do they like about? Of course, it requires open-ended questions. Spend time understanding your customers. That'll help you unearth rich insights about them.\n\nWith Sworkit, we talked about individuals needing customized workout plans. You can take this information as a given or go ahead and dig deeper to understand why is this needed. It could be a variety of reasons:  \n- Someone is going through the recovery process and needs to have a custom-built exercises that help them recover without injuring them further\n- Their fitness goal is very specific: improve core strength and become flexible\n- Their current workout needs a few exercises to be swapped before they could progress to the next fitness level and utilize a pre-defined workout. \n\n### Observe Your Customers\nObserve your customers. You cannot uncover user-experience focused requirements if you have not observed your target customers in their environment.\n\nIn the Sworkit example, we will observe our target customers in a fitness gym. \n\nYou observe that users take a break for a few minutes and in some instances, a few users started an exercise and skipped it to move on to the next one. \n\nObserving these nuances helps you ask clarifying questions to gather insights such as : \n- One user skipped an exercise due to body soreness today while the other needed to take a break for a few minutes before resuming their workout.\n\nThese insights cannot be found unless you observe your target customers and talk to them. Then, when you design the product you will add a feature to skip an exercise or pause and resume a workout. When your customer uses this, they will be delighted and probably say ‘ this product gets me. I like it!’ \n\n**That is a moment for you to rejoice! **\n",

A common slang you may hear is ‘dogfooding’, where the company tests the product that is going to launch to identify and fix issues. In this scenario, there is no product launch but you are testing the product to understand how it functions.\n\nSome questions to think about: \n- What information is requested from the user on a specific page?\n- How long does the page take to load?\n- What happens when the product is tested on a cellular network?\n\nAnother important reason to test is you will understand:\n- How does your product interact with other parts of the company's product(s)? \n \nUsing the Sworkit example here, if you joined their product team, how would you go about getting up to speed on the product?\n\nYou might take a look at the images from the app store listing, just like a user would and read the information and reviews. You might download the app and try to create a new account using a non-existent account to read the error messages displayed and try to request a new password. The goal here is to understand how useful or informative are the error messages.\n\nYou might try out a few workouts, and see if the summary received was insightful? You might opt into the notifications or reminders and see how they work. Essentially be put yourself in the shoes of a user.\n\nBy the time you finished testing, you would have formed an opinion:\n- Is the product delighting its users? \n- Is the product meeting the customer needs? IF not, where are the gaps? \n\nThe answers to all of these questions and your experience will lead you to your first list of issues and improvements.\n",

Spend time understanding how the data is being tracked and what tools are being used such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Kissmetrics, etc.\n\nDepending upon the analytics platform the company uses, you can understand the user journey within the product to find where do they exist, what do they most frequently use the product for by understanding the tracking events triggered based on the user's interaction with the product.\n\nYou may want to analyze data on your own. In order to do this, you need to know the name of the events triggered.  For example, when a user clicks on the ‘Sign Up’  button in the mobile app, is the tracking event fired under the name ‘mobile sign up cta’ or ‘mobile sign up submit’.  This is an effective way to familiarize yourself with the analytics platform. Use the analytics platform to understand how your product is currently performing. This is going to help you not only identify areas of improvement but also understand how to prioritize issues, what requirements need to be written to implement a new feature \n\nWhen you utilize the information from testing the product and understanding the right data you will be able to pull the list of feature requests, issues, and roadmap initiatives that will help you identify the strengths and weaknesses of your product. Only then will you understand the feature request, the product strategy, and initiatives more completely. \n\n#### Additional Resources\n- [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/)\n- [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/)\n- [Kissmetrics](https://www.kissmetricshq.com/)",

After the product launch, they will be your front line team members interacting with irate customers sometimes and helping them to resolve issues. \n- Account Management Team: Their name varies across companies such as client management, customer success, client implementation, and operations, etc. The account managers step in once the product has been sold. They take over the client relationship from the sales team to onboard and continue to manage the client relationship through product upgrades and renewals. You may partner with this team closely to receive customer feedback early on during the solution discovery phase, attend calls to pitch your new product idea, or resolve a major customer concern. \n- Finance Team: you will be responsible to make sure their reporting and accounting needs are met.

              "text": "### Know your development teams\n__What existing challenges need to be addressed?__ Understand the current product implementation.  How is the product built?\nWhat are the engineering goals you need to be aware of?\nFrom your 1x 1 meeting with the development team members, you gained a sneak peek into  how the product has been built and how testing works.\n\nIt is essential to __understanding the inner workings of both the product and the team__.  Meet with them again if needed. We will focus on understanding the engineering implementation and testing process.\nIn your meeting with the engineering lead, understand how the product is built (e.g., architecture design). What are the challenges that need to be addressed?\nAre there any engineering goals to be accomplished? As a PM you are going to be __managing a single list of tasks to complete__ (which is called __backlog__) and if that does not reflect their engineering goals how can they meet their goal?\n\n \n### Understand the current testing process\nExtend the same philosophy to the QA team member.\n#### How is the product tested?\nUnderstand how they test a product: Do they have a combination of manual testing and automated testing?\nIf you used manual testing to try to break the product to know the product, try automated testing. Automated testing does not require someone to sit in front of a screen and interact with the product. Automated testing could be done by utilizing a third-party tool or writing scripts that need to be run. \n Let’s take the example of mobile apps that are in IOS and Android: A combination of manual and automated testing is used.\n It is important to ensure the best user experience is available across all devices and platforms. __Third-party tools__ may be used to verify the user experience across different platforms and devices without the need for a team to maintain an inventory of every device used by the target customers. \n__When automated testing used?__ Some teams automate the verification of existing features to ensure they are not broken when an existing feature is improved or a new feature is added. \n**When Manual Testing is used?** Manual testing is typically conducted when a new feature is being built and launched, and QA members will test the new feature by interacting with it. Some companies add automation to the new feature as well and may verify critical existing functionalities manually \n\n#### What existing challenges need to be addressed?\nWhat are the challenges in the testing process? Some of their challenges cannot be resolved by Product Managers, while others can be. Let’s take an example that I have often seen teams run into, and I personally did at the early stages of my career. Many QA team members like conducting exploratory testing for a new product, especially a critical product. During my early stint as a Product Manager,  when the QA team member had completed their verification, I noticed far more critical issues while testing the product previously gone unnoticed and these got me very frustrated. What went wrong here? \nI met with the testers and shared my feedback, expressed my disappointment in how their testing was not giving the desired coverage. After some back and forth, we realized the real problem was the issues I identified by testing were due to my understanding of how users tend to behave in the real world and their constraints. I had not shared this information in full details with the testers.\n<br> Your responsibility __as a product manager is to be the eyes and voice of your users__ to the development team. Take all the learnings and insights about your customer and their environment and including emotional aspect of the users, so that the tester is able to put themselves in the shoes of the user and various emotions they go through and test the product to find critical issues and provide feedback on the product usability as well.\n__Understand their goals.__ For e.g., a QA team wants to reduce the number of critical issues that are identified when the product goes live by x % within the next 3 months. Knowing this will help you understand how to coordinate early on and test the product to launch a high-quality product\n\n### Know your teams\n\n#### Unleash the power of One on Ones: \nSet up __regular one on ones__  to meet with team members in your core team and peer teams.  Develop a communication channel where feedback, ideas, and issues can be shared without any concerns because of the underlying trust that binds all of you together. Spend sufficient time knowing how does your core team work and also how is the product built and tested. These are layers to the knowledge foundation that you need to be able to collaborate effectively \n\n<ul>\n<li>Develop open communication channel between teams </li>\n<li>Know the inner workings of the team</li>\n<li>Gain knowledge and learn to collaborate effectively</li>\n</ul>",
