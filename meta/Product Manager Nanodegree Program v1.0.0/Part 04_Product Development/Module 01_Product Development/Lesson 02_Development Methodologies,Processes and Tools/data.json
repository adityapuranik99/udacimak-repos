Let's understand each of these phases better:\n- ** Gather Requirements ** : The requirements must be fully captured and defined through rigorous documentation in the form of an elaborate requirements document. \n- ** Design the solution **: The requirements are utilized to design the product that details the functional or system requirements and aids in defining engineering architecture. The requirements and solution may be functionality focused instead of being customer-centric. \n- ** Develop the solution **: The scope of work is broken into smaller manageable units and developed independently. Each unit of work is tested to confirm whether the intended functionality has been developed and this is called as Unit Testing \n- ** Test the solution **: The units developed and verified in the previous phase are combined or integrated. This integrated system is tested thoroughly for any issues or failures.\n- ** Deploy the solution **: Once the product has been exhaustively and comprehensively tested, it is deployed to the production environment for customers to start using it.\n- ** Maintenance and support **: When issues arise, they are fixed. Enhancements to the product go through the same process to deliver the changes \nEach phase requires a sign-off from an approver ( for e.g. in the case of Gather Requirements and Design the Solution - it could be the enterprise customer for a B2B2C product) to ensure there is no overlap between phases ( e.g. gather requirements and design the solution).\n\nThe waterfall methodology has been adopted by the development and product team based on various factors, which make the linear and sequential process a more appropriate approach:\n- Requirements are not ambiguous and fixed.\n- Ample resources with the expertise required to develop and launch the project are available for a significant amount of time at the project’s disposal\n- Project timeline is short",

This requires a shift in the development methodology's focus from following rigid processes to focusing on people and how they collaborate. \n\nAgile methodology is centered around this need to respond to change and adapt. It is an iterative approach to software development, where requirements and solutions evolve through constant collaboration and clear communication within the self-organizing cross-functional team. A self-organizing team decides how to get things done versus waiting for another person (e.g. project manager) to step in and lead the team to figure out what needs to be done next.\n\nKanban and Scrum are popular frameworks that enable teams to embrace and follow agile principles, and helping teams deliver value faster without compromising quality.\n\nWe'll learn more about both in the next sections of the lesson.",

It also allows the development team to restore the codebase to a stable version when undesirable or unstable changes are added to the code base. \n- Developers always start with the most current and stable version of codebase called the master or main trunk and make a copy (called as a branch) to their local environment. \n- Once the developer adds new features or makes modifications to an existing feature, they write and execute test cases to ensure their modified code passes. This is called unit testing. \n- When developers merge their unit-test verified code directly, conflicts may occur. Many teams adopt continuous integration, where the modified codebase is validated by running automated tests. This helps the development team identify and resolve conflicts earlier and improve delivery speed \n- Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration, where the latest version of the master is deployed automatically to an internal environment called staging. \n- QA team conducts comprehensive and exhaustive manual testing in the staging environment. The product manager conducts user acceptance testing, feature demo and sign-off with internal stakeholders here. \n- In most companies deployment to production is manual\n- After deploying the latest version of the codebases to production, smoke tests are run to verify whether basic functions and critical features are working as expected ",
